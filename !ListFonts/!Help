Listfonts is a program that can be used to produce a list of all the
fonts availiable on your computer.  This is especially useful if you
have lots of fonts but cannot remember what they are all like. List
fonts produces a textfile of all the fonts available at the time it is
run, and the textfile can then be imported into Impression or later
versions of TechWriter/EasiWriter for printing.  If you do not have
TechWriter/EasiWriter or any version of Impression then

a) Buy TechWriter or EasiWriter

b) Download Impression Junior. It is avaliable free to download from
Computer Concepts website http://www.cconcepts.co.uk/support/junior.htm
and was also on the Archimedes World CDROM a few years ago and more
recently the Kosovo CD.

Even if you do b) you should also do a) as well :-)

Using ListFonts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just double click on the !ListFonts icon, and a standard save window will appear.  Drag the icon to an empty Impression/TechWriter/EasiWriter window, and the list will be generated.  This may take a little time if you have a lot of fonts and/or a slower computer.  Then you can format the list into columns or however you want as you would with normal text, printing it out if you wish.
The default is to produce a list with one entry for each font family, eg. bold and italic variants of a font are not listed.  If you want all variants of a font to be listed then before dragging the icon to the Impression window click the middle mouse button, and click on the menu item "One font per family" to deselect it, then carry on as normal.
I strongly advise you to set the font cache as big as possible (several megabytes if you have enough memory), as even when it is a megabyte on a StrongARM there is still a lot of disc activity, and it takes a long time to redraw a page with a long list of fonts on.

Changing the text
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By default the text used in the list is
This is Trinity
This is Homerton
etc.
This may be changed by clicking menu over the save window, and changing
the text in the Text Used submenu. Any characters can be used except the
% character. if you want to include the font name in the text then put
%s where you want it to appear. You can only include the font name once.
For example, the default text is
This is %s

Problems
~~~~~~~~
Either Impression or the font manager, I'm not sure which, cannot cope with more than 250 fonts in a document at once, and so if you try with a list of more than 250 fonts, Impression gives an error and will not let you continue.  Therefore if you have more than 250 fonts you should select the "Split up list" menu item, altering the number of fonts per list if you wish, and the icon will change to a directory.  This can then be dragged to a disc, and the list of fonts will be split into several files within the directory, named numerically.  These files can then be dragged to the Impression window, although it is recommended that Impression is quit then reloaded between each file.
